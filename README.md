# willow
Willow Engine: An Open-GL Game Engine Project

# install
Just run install.sh to compile or recompile the project

# Run
run run.sh to run the program (or run the file named "program" in the bin folder)

# dev
run cmakeWatch to auto recompile everytime you save,
(best not to use right now because it
redownloads every external library everytime
and takes time)

# gui
to build and run easily, use gui.py
